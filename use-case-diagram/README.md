# Use Case Diagram

This directory contains the Use Case Diagram for the Airbnb Clone project. The diagram visualizes the different actors in the system and their interactions with the core functionalities.

## Actors
The system is designed around three primary actors:
1.  **Guest:** A user who searches for and books properties.
2.  **Host:** A user who lists properties and manages bookings.
3.  **Admin:** A system administrator who manages users and content.

## Key Use Cases
* **Registration & Authentication:** All users must register and log in.
* **Property Management:** Hosts can create and update listings.
* **Booking Process:** Guests can search for properties, view details, and make bookings.
* **Booking Management:** Hosts can accept or reject booking requests.

## Diagram
Below is the visual representation of these interactions:
