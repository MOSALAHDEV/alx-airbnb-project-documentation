# User Stories

This directory contains the user stories for the Airbnb Clone project. These stories serve as the functional requirements for the application, describing features from the perspective of the end-user.

## Purpose
The goal of these user stories is to:
1.  Capture the specific needs of different user roles (Guests, Hosts, Admins).
2.  Provide a clear "Definition of Done" for developers.
3.  Bridge the gap between technical requirements and user value.

## Format
Each user story follows the standard Agile format:
> **"As a [Role], I want to [Action], so that [Benefit]."**

## Contents
* **[user-stories.md](./user-stories.md):** The comprehensive list of all prioritized user stories for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

## Key Roles
* **Guest:** Users looking for accommodation.
* **Host:** Users offering properties for rent.
